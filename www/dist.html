    <h3>Project Summary</h3>

    <p> Developments in the understanding of the stress response to massive burns have led to a significant reduction in mortality. However, burn survivors develop several metabolic abnormalities and arguably the most detrimental is excessive muscle wasting. Burn-induced muscle catabolism leads to reduced strength, delayed rehabilitation, increased morbidity and mortality. Skeletal muscle serves as a protein depot to buffer plasma amino acid concentrations due to heightened demand for acute phase protein synthesis and wound healing.</p>

    <p> To meet protein requirements of burn patients, protein intake of 1.5 to 3.0 g·kg-1·day-1 is recommended while higher intake should be avoided since evidence suggest that do not provide additional benefit and may be harmful. However, the current upper limits are based on the findings of only two clinical studies. Those studies had several methodological limitations, and the findings were not definitive. Therefore, the potential beneficial effect of higher than currently recommended protein intake is understudied.</p>

    <p> Assessment of muscle wasting requires the accurate evaluation of the protein synthesis and breakdown. Measurement of protein kinetics are optimal for mechanistic investigations on the molecular mechanism of muscle wasting and for evaluating the acute effect on protein turnover of various therapeutic agents. Therefore, high precision in protein kinetics estimation is of primary importance. Stable isotope methods are currently the most accurate and least invasive approach in vivo. Current methodology is based on radioactive isotope methods where the tracer amount used is practically massless; therefore, adaptations have been made to increase the validity of stable isotopes methods. Despite the corrections, experimental measurements often deviate from the theoretically expected values. All stable isotope techniques depend on the accuracy of the stable isotope enrichments in circulatory blood and tissues, especially in very low enrichments such as diluted by high food intake. A minor error in the calculation of enrichment could lead to significant errors in the final results, particularly in the calculation involving decay kinetics.</p>

    <p>In Shriners Hospitals for Children in Galveston, hundreds of stable isotope metabolic studies have been conducted over the last two decades, measuring protein kinetics in severely burn pediatric patients. While metabolic study protocols were similar, patients were studied under varying nutritional conditions therefore the effect of protein intake during metabolic study on protein kinetics can be examined. Our specific aims are as follows: </p>

    <p> <b>Aim 1:</b> Increase the precision of mass spectrometry isotope enrichment estimation of patient samples by:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Establishing a method for the statistical derivation of the isotopic purity of the tracer.
      </li>
      <li>Modeling the observed mass spectrum, using the statistical properties of the mass distribution of tracee and tracer.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p> <b>Aim 2:</b> To determine the effect of dietary intake on muscle protein kinetics in severely burned children by:
    </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Retrospectively assess the effect of varying levels of protein intake on muscle protein kinetics in a group of patients studied while receiving protein intake at levels routinely administered in normal clinical conditions
        </li>
        <li>Assessing the impact of applying the method in Aim 1 for the estimation of protein kinetics, on the interpretation of the results.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <p>The retrospective analysis of multitude of protein kinetics data is an excellent opportunity for a cost-effective investigation of the understudied effect of protein intake on severe burns. Given the scarcity of relevant data in the literature and the tremendous debilitating effect of burn induced muscle catabolism it is likely that the findings of this analysis will be of high clinical interest and a significant addition to the existing literature.

        <p> <b>Aim 1:</b> Increase the precision of mass spectrometry isotope enrichment estimation of patient samples by:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Establishing a method for the statistical derivation of the isotopic purity of the tracer.
            <ul>
              <li> The effect of labeling on the skewness of tracer’s mass distribution is usually underestimated. Obtaining an accurate estimate of the tracer’s isotopic purity is expected to increase accuracy in enrichment estimation
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Modeling the observed mass spectrum, using the statistical properties of the mass distribution of tracee and tracer. 
            <ul>
              <li>The methods used for calculation of enrichment for mass spectrometry reading do not take into account the statistical properties of the mass distributions of tracee and tracers. Using this additional information is expected increase precision in enrichment estimation.
              </li>
            </ul>
        </ol> 

        <p> <b>Aim 2:</b> To determine the effect of dietary intake on muscle protein kinetics in severely burned children by:
        </p> 

        <ol>
          <li> a) Retrospectively assess the effect of varying levels of protein intake on muscle protein kinetics in a group of patients studied while receiving protein intake at levels routinely administered in normal clinical conditions.  
            <ul>
              <li> Enteral feeding was not under experimental control and patients were studied during the fed state. Thus, we expect protein intake levels among subjects will vary within a range that will allow the examination of our hypothesis. The large sample size allows for inclusion of covariates in the statistical analysis.  
              </li>
              <li> The variability of random differences in protein intake among patients during the study period will partly explain the variability of protein kinetics and higher levels of protein intake will be positively associated with a lower catabolic state. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Assessing the impact of applying the method in Aim 1 for the estimation of protein kinetics, on the interpretation of the results.  
            <ul>
              <li> Kinetic parameters for Aim 2 will be calculated using both the established and the new method. In metabolic studies with primed constant tracer infusion protocol (such as studies involved in Aim 2), where the steady state enrichment rarely exceeds 7%, the new methodology is expected to provide a mild improvement in accuracy of enrichment estimation.  
              </li>
              <li> Improvement of kinetic parameters estimation in pulse bolus tracer injection metabolic studies (such as those performed in SHC- Galveston from 2008 and on) is expected to be high and critical to the proper interpretation of the derived kinetic parameters.
