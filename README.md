# R-Shiny-IsotopicDistributionTracers

## 1. Project Summary

Developments in the understanding of the stress response to massive burns have led to a
significant reduction in mortality. However, burn survivors develop several metabolic
abnormalities and arguably the most detrimental is excessive muscle wasting.  Burn-induced
muscle catabolism leads to reduced strength, delayed rehabilitation, increased morbidity
and mortality. Skeletal muscle serves as a protein depot to buffer plasma amino acid
concentrations due to heightened demand for acute phase protein synthesis and wound
healing.

To meet protein requirements of burn patients, protein intake of $`1.5\-3.0\ g·kg^{-1}·day^{-1}`$
is recommended while higher intake should be avoided since evidence suggest that do not
provide additional benefit and may be harmful. However, the current upper limits are based
on the findings of only two clinical studies.  Those studies had several methodological
limitations, and the findings were not definitive. Therefore, the potential beneficial
effect of higher than currently recommended protein intake is understudied.

Assessment of muscle wasting requires the accurate evaluation of the protein synthesis and
breakdown. Measurement of protein kinetics are optimal for mechanistic investigations on
the molecular mechanism of muscle wasting and for evaluating the acute effect on protein
turnover of various therapeutic agents.  Therefore, high precision in protein kinetics
estimation is of primary importance. Stable isotope methods are currently the most
accurate and least invasive approach in vivo. Current methodology is based on radioactive
isotope methods where the tracer amount used is practically massless; therefore,
adaptations have been made to increase the validity of stable isotopes methods.  Despite
the corrections, experimental measurements often deviate from the theoretically expected
values. All stable isotope techniques depend on the accuracy of the stable isotope
enrichments in circulatory blood and tissues, especially in very low enrichments such as
diluted by high food intake. A minor error in the calculation of enrichment could lead to
significant errors in the final results, particularly in the calculation involving decay
kinetics.

In Shriners Hospitals for Children in Galveston, hundreds of stable isotope metabolic
studies have been conducted over the last two decades, measuring protein kinetics in
severely burn pediatric patients. While metabolic study protocols were similar, patients
were studied under varying nutritional conditions therefore the effect of protein intake
during metabolic study on protein kinetics can be examined. Our specific aims are as
follows:

**Aim 1:** Increase the precision of mass spectrometry isotope enrichment estimation of
patient samples by:

1. Establishing a method for the statistical derivation of the isotopic purity of the
   tracer.
2. Modeling the observed mass spectrum, using the statistical properties of the mass
   distribution of tracee and tracer.

**Aim 2:** To determine the effect of dietary intake on muscle protein kinetics in
severely burned children by:

1. Retrospectively assess the effect of varying levels of protein intake on muscle protein
   kinetics in a group of patients studied while receiving protein intake at levels
   routinely administered in normal clinical conditions.
2. Assessing the impact of applying the method in Aim 1 for the estimation of protein
   kinetics, on the interpretation of the results.

The retrospective analysis of multitude of protein kinetics data is an excellent
opportunity for a cost-effective investigation of the understudied effect of protein
intake on severe burns. Given the scarcity of relevant data in the literature and the
tremendous debilitating effect of burn induced muscle catabolism it is likely that the
findings of this analysis will be of high clinical interest and a significant addition to
the existing literature.

## 2. Specific Aims

**Aim 1:** Increase the precision of mass spectrometry isotope enrichment estimation of
patient samples by:

1. Establishing a method for the statistical derivation of the isotopic purity of the tracer.
  * The effect of labeling on the skewness of tracer’s mass distribution is usually underestimated. Obtaining an accurate estimate of the tracer’s isotopic purity is expected to increase accuracy in enrichment estimation.

2. Modeling the observed mass spectrum, using the statistical properties of the mass distribution of tracee and tracer. 
  * The methods used for calculation of enrichment for mass spectrometry reading do not take
into account the statistical properties of the mass distributions of tracee and tracers. 
Using this additional information is expected increase precision in enrichment estimation. 

**Aim 2:** To determine the effect of dietary intake on muscle protein kinetics in severely
burned children by:

1. Retrospectively assess the effect of varying levels of protein
intake on muscle protein kinetics in a group of patients studied while receiving protein
intake at levels routinely administered in normal clinical conditions. 
  * Enteral feeding was not under experimental control and patients were studied during the
fed state. Thus, we expect protein intake levels among subjects will vary within a range
that will allow the examination of our hypothesis. The large sample size allows for
inclusion of covariates in the statistical analysis.
  * The variability of random differences in protein intake among patients during the study
period will partly explain the variability of protein kinetics and higher levels of
protein intake will be positively associated with a lower catabolic state.

2. Assessing the impact of applying the method in Aim 1 for the estimation of protein
kinetics, on the interpretation of the results.
  * Kinetic parameters for Aim 2 will be calculated using both the established and the new
method. In metabolic studies with primed constant tracer infusion protocol (such as
studies involved in Aim 2), where the steady state enrichment rarely exceeds 7%, the new
methodology is expected to provide a mild improvement in accuracy of enrichment
estimation.
  * Improvement of kinetic parameters estimation in pulse bolus tracer injection metabolic
studies (such as those performed in SHC- Galveston from 2008 and on) is expected to be
high and critical to the proper interpretation of the derived kinetic parameters.


## 3. Research Strategy

### A. *Significance*

Detailed assessment of the severity of muscle wasting in burn patients requires the
accurate evaluation of the muscle protein synthesis and breakdown. In vivo measurement of
protein kinetics is optimal for mechanistic investigations on the molecular mechanism of
muscle wasting and for evaluating the acute effect on protein turnover of various
therapeutic agents. Therefore, <u>high precision and accuracy in protein kinetics
measurements is of primary importance</u>.

Stable isotope methods are currently the most feasible (noninvasive) and accurate in vivo
approach to estimate protein kinetics in burn patients(1). The isotopic distribution of
atoms in nature (tracee) does not vary much and is well recorded. In metabolic research
tracers are molecules where several atoms on their structure have been artificially
exchanged with heavier (usually by 1 neutron) isotopes of the same atoms(2). The
determination of substrate kinetics is possible through the measurement of enrichment
(ratio of tracer-to-tracee) over time.

The attachment of heavier atoms on tracers does not only cause a shift in mass
distribution but also changes of skewness of the distribution. The difference in the
skewness of mass distributions of tracee and tracer can be amplified by the degree of
tracer’s isotopic purity. A tracer with 99% isotopic purity does not mean that 99% of the
molecules are labeled and 1% is not.  It means that each labeled atom has 99% change of
being actually exchanged with the heavier isotope. For example, in a sample of tracer
molecules, having 10 labeled atoms with 99% isotopic purity, only 0.99<sup>10</sup> = 90.4% of the
molecules will have all 10 atoms labeled.

Currently, methods for the calculation of enrichment from mass spectrometry data(2,3)
either underestimate the effect of labeling on tracer’s mass distribution, leading to
biased estimates, or/and ignore statistical properties of tracee and tracer mass
distribution leading to increased variability. A method that takes into account both
factors is expected to <u>improve the accuracy and precision of enrichment estimation</u>.

A major unsolved metabolic problem in burn injury is muscle wasting the loss of protein mass
and strength of the skeletal muscle. In critical illness, loss of lean mass is associated
with increased morbidity(4) and mortality(5). For patients with respiratory failure, it
significantly prolongs the ventilation time and ICU stay(6). Severe burn injury is
characterized by increased whole body protein turnover and a pronounced increase in muscle
protein breakdown to a degree that cannot be matched by the concurrent increase in muscle
protein synthesis, resulting in net loss of muscle mass(7,8).  <u>It appears that in severe
burns the body sacrifices skeletal muscle to meet the high demand of amino acids necessary
for wound healing and for production of acute phase proteins</u>(9,10).

To meet the elevated daily protein requirements of burn patients, the evidence-based
guidelines of the American Burn Association (ABA) recommend protein intake of $1.5-3.0 \ 
g·kg^{-1}·day^{-1}$ (11). The European Society of Parenteral and Enteral
Nutrition (ESPEN) recommends intake of $1.5-3\ g·kg^{-1}·day^{-1}$ in burned
children and $1.5-2\ g·kg^{-1}·day^{-1}$ in burned adults(12). <u>However,
the ABA and ESPEN recommendations were based on evidence from a handful of studies, of
which only one was specific to the effect of protein intake on protein kinetics in burn
injury</u>. Wolfe et al(13) compared the effects of protein intakes of $1.4\
g·kg^{-1}·day^{-1}$ and $2.2\ g·kg^{-1}·day^{-1}$ over a 3-day
period on protein metabolism in 6 severely burned adults using a cross-over study design.
Protein turnover was significantly greater in the high versus low protein regimen but the
difference between protein synthesis and breakdown was non-significant. Urea production
rate was elevated only in the high protein regimen, suggesting that additional amount of
the administered protein was partly excreted. Patterson et al.1997(14) investigated the
effect of protein intake ranging from $1.15\ g·kg^{-1}·day^{-1}$ to $2.92\
g·kg^{-1}·day^{-1}$ on protein metabolism of 12 pediatric patients with
average burn size of 25% of body area. In agreement with the study by Wolfe et al.(13),
higher protein intake was positively correlated with the urea production rate.  Endogenous
amino acid rate of appearance, an index of whole-body protein breakdown, was not
associated with protein intake. However, the study design precluded concurrent measurement
of whole body protein synthesis and thus net balance; there does not allow for definitive
conclusions. 

Even though high protein supplementation is an obvious intervention against muscle
catabolism, <u>the upper limits of the current recommendations are based on the findings of
only two studies</u>. Apart from small sample sizes, the whole body protein kinetics methods
employed in those studies provide information only for substrates that appear in the
plasma pool(15), which is an additional limitation of the current evidence. Even if very
high protein intake did not provide further improvement in whole body protein kinetics,
that might not be the case for muscle mass(15).  Therefore, <u>the potential beneficial
effect of higher than currently recommended protein intake is understudied</u>.

enrichment of 20% was prepared. Visual inspection of the figure below shows that the new
method seems to improve accuracy (close to the true enrichment) and precision (low spread

**Background:** The main motivation for this aim is that currently the error in enrichment
determination due to the isotopic impurity of the tracers used in kinetics studies is
considered negligible and thus completely ignored. As mentioned in the significance
section, a 99% isotopic purity means that any single labeled atom in the tracer’s has a
probability of 99% to be indeed labeled (17). In Table 2 are displayed the natural
isotopic abundances of atoms that are commonly encountered in metabolic research. The
fractional abundances of atoms are considered constant; thus, according to the table,
98.9% of carbon atoms encountered in nature have Mass Number 12 and only 1.1% have Mass
number 13. The fractional distribution of complex molecules composed of different atoms,
each one having a specific number of naturally occurring isotopic species, can be found by
polynomial expansion, convolution integral or Fast Fourier Transform algorithm (FFT)(18). 

By using computational software the fractional distribution of complex molecules can be
estimated. The input for the algorithm is the chemical formula (type and number of atoms),
and the natural abundance of atoms, which is given in tables as the one displayed above
(16). The chemical formula of the amino acid phenylalanine is $C_9H_{11}NO_2$. GCMS analysis
requires chemical processing of the sample, which results in incorporation of additional
atoms on the molecule. Moreover, the process of ionization results in the breaking of
chemical bonds of the new molecule at specific positions, yielding a characteristic
profile of mass spectrum. One abundant fragment of phenylalanine, has the chemical formula
$C_{17}H_{30}N_1O_2Si_2$. Using an algorithm
written in R programming language, the estimated natural isotopic distribution is the
following.
